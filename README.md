# Snake Game

This project is a **classic Snake game** built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It was developed as part of a code-along tutorial on YouTube, where I learned how to implement game mechanics like movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

## Overview

The Snake game is a simple web-based game where the player controls a snake that grows in length each time it eats food. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while trying to eat as much food as possible.

This project helped me understand core JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and basic game development principles.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves across the grid based on arrow key input.
- **Food Spawning**: Randomly generated food appears for the snake to eat.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food and grows longer.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is responsive and playable on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, including movement, collisions, and score.
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the game grid.
- **CSS3**: Styles the game grid and snake elements.
